# Default working directory for new windows
#@@@ This is definitely up to user taste.

# If tmux version < 1.9, such as on RHEL6:
#set default-path .
# If empty, infer from existing shells. (The default value)
# If $HOME or ~, always open there.
# If . then use the working directory when tmux was started. (GNU Screen's default)

### If tmux version is >= 1.9:
#bind c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
# If not set, they always open in the directory where tmux was originally started.
# If set, always opens to the location specified in variable. (Either environment or tmux variable, your choice)
# Warning: this also binds Prefix + C, so be aware if you're dealing with that sequence, or new-window, anywhere else.

# Use C-a prefix, a la GNU Screen
set -g prefix C-a
bind C-a last-window
bind a send-prefix

# Screen-style shortcuts
unbind Space
bind Space next-window
bind C-Space next-window
bind BSpace previous-window
#bind A command-prompt "rename-window %%" # I'll try tmux's Comma binding for now
bind Escape copy-mode # since Prefix+Esc+PgUp doesn't kick in Tmux's Prefix+PgUp
bind K confirm-before "kill-window"
bind M-PPage copy-mode -u # Muscle memory, whoa!

# Monitor activity or lack thereof, keystrokes similar to Screen.
# bind M conflicts with Screen's keybind, but with no downside: just hit Enter.
bind m setw monitor-activity
